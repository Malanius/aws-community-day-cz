This talk aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the inner workings of AWS Lambda, one of the most popular serverless computing services. We will cover the mechanisms behind AWS Lambda, including how it achieves effortless scalability and resilience, the pricing model, and techniques for cost optimization. 

Attendees will learn about the process of provisioning, using, and tearing down new runtime instances, and discover the possibilities of customizing runtime behavior or even creating a completely custom runtime from scratch.

It's ideal for developers, architects, and anyone interested in working effectively with AWS Lambda, understanding its limitations and how to overcome them. We will also cover features such as SnapStart, reserved and provisioned capacities, providing attendees with a comprehensive understanding of Lambda's behavior and how to optimize their workloads and reduce costs. By the end of this presentation, attendees will have a solid understanding of how AWS Lambda works, and how to use it to optimize their workloads and reduce costs.
