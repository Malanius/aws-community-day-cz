Publishing a mobile game as a sole developer is harder than ever, with high user expectations, fierce competition, and stringent regulations. 

However, using modern tools and technologies, one man army indie developers with full time jobs can still be a thing in 2024!

This talk focusses on my journey of conceptualising, building, and deploying an iOS & Android mobile game.

We'll go over the serverless AWS architecture, integrating AWS CDK and Amplify CLI, creating Midjourney art and serving it with Cloudfront and S3, and zoom in on the development journey with its many hurdles and curveballs.
