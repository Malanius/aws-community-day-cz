We've all read the Well Architected Framework and followed best practices to build security into our workloads, but of all the controls and recommendations, which make the difference?

Using real-world data and his ten years of cybersecurity experience, Nick will talk through the most common attack scenarios against AWS workloads, and the key security controls to have in place. Attendees will come away with a better understanding of the real security threats to their projects, and guidance on which controls to prioritise, why they matter, and how to balance them against engineering effort.
