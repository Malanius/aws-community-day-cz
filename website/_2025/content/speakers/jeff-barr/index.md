I have been working in the software industry since 1976 when I started working part-time at a computer store while still in high school. Since then I have worked at a variety of large and small organizations, served as VP of Engineering for a startup, worked at Microsoft and Amazon, and worked on my own.

As the Chief Evangelist for the Amazon Web Services, I get to tell the AWS story to audiences all over the world. I talk, I blog, I record videos, and I spread the word via social media.

I am a strong believer in continuing education and recently earned my Master's Degree in Communication and Digital Media from the University of Washington.
