I'm a developer who transitioned into AWS Serverless Architect and I've been falling in love with Serverless ecosystem ever since.

I've discovered Serverless in 2016 and since then it has been one hell of a ride of discovering and building Serverless technologies and heavily pushing production adoption of Serverless architecture at Purple Technology as one of the most advanced Serverless adopters in CEE region.

In the beginning of 2022 at age of 23 I was named AWS Serverless Hero and because one of the youngest members of this elite AWS program.
