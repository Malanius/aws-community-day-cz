Hi 👋🏽

I'm Michal, Senior Platform Engineer, Cloud Native enthusiast and a Data Scientist with an interest in helping customers find insights scattered throughout the often messy data landscape in an automated manner. In order to do so, I build big data tooling to support data acquisition and analytical workflows, as well as train, deploy and monitor bespoke models.

Competencies: Python/Rust/R, various SQL dialects, machine learning & deep learning frameworks (Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch), APIs and model serving (Flask, Django, FastAPI), deployment & MLOps (Docker, Kubernetes, Flux, Helm @ AWS), BI tools (Looker, Tableau)
