I am an AWS Serverless Hero and Independent Consultant. I have over 15 years of experience in software development and AWS. I was amongst the first to be recognized by AWS as an AWS Hero in 2018.

As an independent consultant, I offer services to clients of all sizes and across many industries and domains, from strategic advice and architecture reviews to workshops and hands-on delivery.
