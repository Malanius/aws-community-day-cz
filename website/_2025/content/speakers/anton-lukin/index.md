I am a seasoned Solutions & Cloud Architect with deep AWS Cloud expertise, seamlessly blending business and technology. My current role involves working closely with strategic CEE customers, assisting C-level executives (Founders, CTOs, CIOs, etc.) in defining their technology vision and strategy, and then helping to build robust, scalable, cost-efficient, and high-performing solutions with product and development teams.

As a T-shaped specialist, I cover the entire AWS Cloud stack with a primary focus on Machine Learning, particularly Generative AI, LLMOps, MLOps, and Timeseries. My proficiency extends to end-to-end ML solutions, ensuring their effective application in various business contexts.

I am also an experienced public speaker, addressing topics such as Business Strategy in IT, Technology, AWS Cloud, and Generative AI. I have spoken at major AWS events, like AWS Cloud Days and Summits, as well as various third-party conferences.

I have a proven track record of leading successful IT projects across diverse industries, including Automotive, Banking, and Luxury Goods, collaborating closely with international clients and C-level management. My versatility and adaptability are showcased through roles ranging from leading architecture teams and IT consultancy to hands-on development.
