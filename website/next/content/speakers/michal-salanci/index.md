My name is Michal Salanci, and I am a Senior DevOps Engineer at Deutsche Telekom in Slovakia. 

For many years, I worked as a Network Engineer, handling various networking equipment such as routers, switches, firewalls, load balancers, and more. In 2021, I made a career shift towards AWS, where I primarily focus on networking, security, serverless and containers. 
I am AWS Community Builder in category Containers and also Leader of AWS User Group Kosice Slovakia and Reykjavik Iceland.
