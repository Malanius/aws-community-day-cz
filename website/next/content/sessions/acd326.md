There is a misunderstanding, that everything is possible with the Serverless Services in AWS, for example that your Lambda function may scale without limitations. But each AWS service (not only Serverless) has a big list of quotas that everybody needs to understand and take into account during the development.

In this talk I'll explain the most important things to be aware of for the scalability of the AWS Serverless services, explain quotas (from the hyper scalability point of view, but not only) of the services like API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, Aurora Serverless, SQS, S3 and others and how to architect your solution with these quotas in mind.
