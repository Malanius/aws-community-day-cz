AWS Workspaces and AWS Appstream are two examples of services that enable users to put their desktop interface on the cloud to offload their compute requirements. They do this however in two completely different manners (and as such, have completely different pricetags).

We will be talking about a scenario we encountered in which we migrated 260 users to appstream, the challenges we encountered in that transistion and about our solution in overcoming a very big limiting factor in using Appstream at scale.

Key takeaways from this session include:

* Understanding the options in personal storage in AWS AppStream and their limitations.
* Insights into the development of an automated storage scaling system using AWS services.
* A technical deepdive into the solutions and the biggest considerations while designing it.
* A cost-benefit analysis highlighting how this solution offers a more economical alternative to AWS Workspaces.
