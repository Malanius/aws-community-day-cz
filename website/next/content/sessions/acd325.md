In today's digital age, efficiently processing and extracting text from scanned documents and images is crucial for many businesses. This session will explore how to leverage AWS managed services to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) effectively. Attendees will be introduced to AWS Textract, a powerful OCR service that automatically extracts printed text, handwriting, and data from documents. Key features such as form extraction will be covered and how to improve inaccurate extracts by creating adapters and integrating other AWS services like Augmented AI for a comprehensive document processing pipeline. Through real-world examples and hands-on demonstrations, participants will learn how to implement OCR solutions that enhance business workflows and improve data accessibility.
