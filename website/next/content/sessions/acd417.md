In the era of (Gen)AI and LLMs, organizations are rushing to adopt this transformative technology. However, the key to success lies in the data platforms that support them. This talk explores how data platforms enable fast flow and manage cognitive load in LLM initiatives, using the lens of Team Topologies.
 
We'll dive into the unique challenges and opportunities of building and managing data platforms. Attendees will learn strategies for designing and managing these platforms to foster collaboration, ensure seamless integration, and optimize performance.

Key takeaways include understanding the pivotal role of data platforms in (Gen)AI + LLM initiatives, learning best practices for designing and managing them, discovering techniques for fostering collaboration between teams, and exploring real-world case studies.

This talk empowers attendees with knowledge and strategies to navigate the complexities of data platforms in the LLM era, driving innovation in their DevOps practices so that we don't need to talk about DataOps, AIOps, MLOps or any other KeywordOps instead of relying in the DevOps foundation.
