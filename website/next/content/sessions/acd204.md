Are you looking to simplify complex networking architectures while modernizing your workloads? Join us to learn how to leverage Amazon VPC Lattice for modernizing your business applications. Breaking down the business logic of your monolith application involves network and application layer complexity coupled with the placement of microservices across multiple VPCs or accounts. Complex network setups and routing policies between accounts/VPCs can directly impact developers' productivity and time to market (TTM). In this session, you will learn how to simplify application networking and build zero-trust architectures using Amazon VPC Lattice when breaking down a monolith application into microservices. We will address several reference architecture patterns for modernization with Amazon VPC Lattice and explore multiple deployment strategies, including weighted routing, path-based, and host-based routing.
