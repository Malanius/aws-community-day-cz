Building applications on AWS comes with many potential advantages, such as less responsibility, reduction in costs, and ""infinite"" scaling to name a few. Because of this, we tend to rely completely on AWS when it comes to certain properties of our applications, such as performance and scalability. 
 
However, simply using AWS is not a guarantee that your AWS application will be able to handle the load as your business grows. How certain are you that your AWS application can handle 2x the current load on production? What about 5x? Can it handle spikes? The only way to really know is to test.

In this session we will discuss how to set up load tests using AWS to test your AWS workload. We will cover the following:

- Why is load testing important?
- Determine what needs to be tested
- Determine how it can be tested
- How do you analyse the test results?
